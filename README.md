## Getting started

1. Clone this repository into a directory and create a new Drupal site at the repository root (using Acquia Dev Desktop).
2. Run `npm install` at `./profiles/dangular/modules/custom/angular` to retrieve all of Angular 2's dependencies.
3. Go to `http://localhost:8080/install.php` to begin the Drupal installation process.
4. Select the `Dangular` installation profile for prewritten content and configuration.
